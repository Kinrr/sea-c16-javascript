Hi there. I'm Stephanie Lingwood.

I'm a relative newbie to coding, having gotten my start in the June Foundations 1 class. I liked it, I developed a new appreciation for patience and syntax errors, and in general I had fun. That's why I'm now in this Foundations 2 class, and am leaning towards applying for the Development Accelerator in October.

My professional background is as an informal educator, primarily focused on science and the outdoors. I also work as a freelance eLearning consultant. What I love about these fields is that I get to create things (in this case, inspiring educational products) that seamlessly fit into the end user's world. That's one major distinction between formal and informal learning; in informal learning, someone has to voluntarily start using your educational product, and you only have their attention until they get distracted by the next shiny object. This is one reason I'm so interested in coding; I like to make things that work, that can meet people's needs, and that can change the world.

I also guide trips for a women's adventure travel company (shameless plug: www.adventuresingoodcompany.com), and try to keep my cats from "helpfully" digging up my garden.
