Hi! My name is Matthew Brightbill. I'm 23 and from Birmingham, Alabama. I have a degree from the University of Alabama in Biology. I was premed and had started applying to medical schools up until about 2 months ago when I decided to move out here. I first started learning some code during my college years and fell in love with it. I'm eager to learn as much as possible and can't wait to learn more JavaScript. I also just finished the F1 night course, and loved every second of it.
