//So I took the suggestion to look at Ternary Operators:

//I also checkedout out other students submissions (especially Jeff's:
//https://github.com/codefellows/sea-c16-javascript/commit/2ae56439eb579230f02174a8ec3eb3fe4f55a0e6)

//It is a lot smaller - but still not nearly as intuitive for me as using the if/else logic.

function preferredName(firstName, lastName) {
  return (!firstName === !lastName) ? false : (firstName || lastName);
  }
  
// == vs ===: No reason in this case - just more familiar with '==' although the internet tells me '==='
//will always evaluate faster due to lack of type conversion so I changed it.

//Check if first and last name variables both evaluate to the same truth value (such that
//if both are "false" (in this case both have valid assignments) they return the ternary
//true which give us the ultimate result of false (expression1). If both are "true" (do not have valid
//assignments) they are still the same and return the ultimate result of false. Finally
//if the first and last names have different truth values (exclusive OR) we recieve a ternary
//false and return whichever has a valid assignment (expression2).
