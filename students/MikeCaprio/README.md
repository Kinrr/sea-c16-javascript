Hi Codefellows! 

My name is Michael Caprio and I'm currently enrolled in the F2 Javascripe class (Section A). I've been living in Seattle for about 2 months now 
and I'm really excited to be getting started working with you guys. 

Prior to starting this class I recieved an A.S. in Computer Science from Hawaii Pacific University. This consisted of about 3 semesters in Java,
some discrete math, calculus, and other foundational stuff. I've also had the opportunity to work on some basic Rails applications (they're on Heroku) 
like an image uploader and quote scraper. 

I'm looking to follow this class up with the Javascript Dev Accelerator starting in August - or as a backup plan another offering in the new year. 

Don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions! 

-Mike
