--- This is the README about Eric Chen ---

Hi! My name is Eric.

My first coding experience is C++ since the college class but I never worked in a software development environment. However, the coding was always attactive to me and now finally I have the chance to learn and be part of developer.

Thank you for your time for reading my short, unexciding, somewhat broken English.
