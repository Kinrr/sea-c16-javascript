So when I saw this assignment, I'd thought there was supposed to be more to it because I remembered seeing something bigger somewhere else about people in objects in arrays and detecting their ages. I was just browsing through the other course topics and it turns out I was thinking about assignment 6.1. So, whoops. Anyway that's why I went all crazy and out-of-scope on the assignment.

BTW: Lodash assignment 5.1 (http://hankyates.github.io/F2-javascript-textbook/class_4/lodash_assignment.html) is 404. (So happens I have an upcoming project that needs a little Lodash knowhow, so timing couldn't be better.)

Thanks!
