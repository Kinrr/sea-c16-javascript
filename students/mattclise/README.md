#Matt Clise

Hello!  My name's Matt Clise, and I'm originally from Maryland.  I'm really excited to learn more JavaScript!

I started my college carrer as an Info Sci & Tech major, but somehow ended up with a BA in Economics and a BS in Accounting. After working as a public accountant for a little over a year and realizing that I hated the job, I decided to try a total career change (back to my original interests) which has led me here.  I really enjoy the logical/strategic thought that coding requires.  I'll probably be looking to do something in the way of financial app dev work given my background, but I'll just be happy to be done with doing anyone's taxes by my own.

As an aside, I'm currently reading *The Fall of Hyperion* from the Hyperion Cantos by Dan Simmons.  So far I would definitely recommend the series to anyone interested in good sci fi.
