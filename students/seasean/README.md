A bit about me: My name is Sean Conley. 
I'm presently a grad student pursuing a Masters in Social Work. 
I'm interested in civic coding and learning how to build web based apps in order to help other individuals 
and groups of underserved and disenfranchised populations in our community. 

I've played around with javascript a bit via codeschool 
and the Foundations 1 class and am really excited to learn more.
