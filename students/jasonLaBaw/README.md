# Hi, I'm Jason LaBaw
## About Me
I run an online agency, [Bonsai Media Group](http://www.bonsaimediagroup.com). ![Bonsai Media Group](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-I-brZgJw7zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/WByS5o6E9mw/photo.jpg). We're a small team of 14 designers, developers and marketers. 

I got into development via the Marketing side, SEO. Received dev certs from WWU. After trying to do everything I realized a team of specialist is essential to success online, hence the imputus to starting Bonsai.
