My name is Tim. I want to become a skilled full-stack software developer. I have co-founded an educational applications company called General Applications Co. based in Seoul, Korea with an international student, one of whom I often coached on writing term papers, while double majoring in mathematics and statistics at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. I would like to quickly finish the three questions for the development accelerator this week to secure my spot, assuming that there will be spots left by then; my interest in the development accelerator is to accelerate my ability to quickly develop web/mobile applications/servers to create useful and eventually profitable applications. In addition, I am equally interested in penetration testing. Generally, I have many things going on at once and I'm used to tight deadlines and pressures; I tend to learn very quick under high pressure and very slowly under low pressure. On the other hand, I have neglected my body, which needs to change now.
